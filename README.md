# Movies-ETL
In this repository, you will find the code for the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process which was used on the movies ratings data from multiple sources including: Wikipedia, Keggle and MovieLens. 

Tools needed: Ju[yter Notebook, PostGresDB
Library needed: numpy, panda, re, json, sqlalchemy, time psycopg2

The code goes through multiples technique for all three steps in the ETL process to gives us a Database of Movies information as well as their ratings data. If you ran the code on your environment, you will have 2 tables in your PostGresDB: movies and ratings.

# Please be advise that the ratings data is quite large.
